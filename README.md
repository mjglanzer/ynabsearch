### Acquiring a YNAB API Key
To use the "ynabsearch" project, you will need to have a YNAB account and obtain an API key. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Log in to your YNAB account.
2. Go to the Developer Settings in your account settings.
3. Create a new personal access token by clicking on "New Token".
4. Copy the token and use it as the api-key when running the ynabsearch CLI.

Note that personal access tokens grant full access to your YNAB data, so it's important to keep them secure. If you need to revoke a token, you can do so from the Developer Settings page.
